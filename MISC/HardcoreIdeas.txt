=+=Options I would like to see for Hardcore mod=+=
I think these options would be best implemented with console commands that can be set by menu elements that you can "click and check" and enable on the pregame screen. 


Bullet drop after X distance 
Add a "Disable Explosive Barrels" command and vote option. (and include it in the explosive list)
No colored outlines 
No class tags above the head
No hit Markers
No names when pointing at someone
No points or kill confirmation with name
Award Ribbons at end of match
Only medics can see other peoples health
No one can see other peoples health
Can't fire weapon if up against wall with gun not in firing position.
No Radio Chat Log
Can't sprint with LMG and fire at the same time
Delayed Kill feed by X seconds
Disable Kill feed entirely (I wouldn't play with this on but maybe other people would)
Don't show current round count in magazine. (Still show ammo stockpile though) 
Disable the weapon icons that are on the right hand of the screen
Limit the length of how long you can hold your breath

If you can do any of these things already with console commands, let me know.
